This is the R code to run the agent based models. 

There are four folders:
- code: contains the R scripts for the two agent based models
- networks: contains the networks needed for the agent based model; these networks can be replicated with the code in 1_create_networks
- data: contains pre-processed data from previous runs of the models to replicate the figures in the paper
- results: contains empty folders to store the results when running the two agent based models
