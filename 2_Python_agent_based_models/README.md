This is the Python code to run the agent based models. 

There are four folders:
- code: contains the Pythone scripts for the two agent based models and the R code to summarise the output
- networks: contains the networks needed for the agent based model; these networks can be replicated with the code in 1_create_networks; they are renamed to make analysis easier
- results: empty folder for the results
- data: contains pre-processed data for later steps
